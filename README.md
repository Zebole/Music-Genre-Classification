# Music-Genre-Classification
Exam for the Advanced Data Science Course - Machine Learning



You work for a really cool audio streaming company, who want YOU to use machine learning to train a model to classify audio tracks into genres. This could be solved by identifying keywords by the playlist name, but the playlist names are really messy (check it out), and according to their “research” a machine learning model should be able to label the tracks into genres more accurately.

The company has asked YOU and your fabulous team to help them make sense of all their data, and help them understand how they can use machine learning to classify music. They are particularly interested in the following:
- Your Exploratory Data Analysis, that identifies initial patterns between the genres
- The data you would use to help them make their predictions
- The machine learning model you suggest would be best at helping them solve their problem. 
- They are also interested in understanding if machine learning is the right approach, before they invest time and $$$$
- The features with most predictive power
